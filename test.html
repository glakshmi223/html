            <p>India profoundly defeated West Indies by five wickets in the first One Day International cricket match, held on Thursday, July 27, at the Kensington Oval in Barbados. The unfortunate outcomes for the host nation were credited to the fall of the West Indies batting, which stunningly collapsed and got dismissed for an insignificant 114, all out in just 23 overs.</p>
